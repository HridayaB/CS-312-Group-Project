            Hello, my name is Hridaya Bijayananda. I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Colorado State University. 
            I started out with a concentration in Software Engineering, but currently I am in the general concentration as I wanted to explore more options for myself.
            I am originally from Nepal and have been in the United States for about ten years.
